# Real-Time Bus Tracker 

The project contains three files: "mapanimation.js", "styles.css" and "index.html"

The project portrays the use of an API to source real-time data of Boston MBTA busses. 
The browser displays an icon that tracks the live location of the bus on the map.
Mapbox was used as an open-source platform that allows to create and display maps on a web page. 
The mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox ecosystem that allows to add customizations to the map.
The move function is called when the button "Show stops between MIT and Hardvard" is selected, and the marker animation will start.

The concepts applied in this project: 
	1. Build web applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
	2. Design and code user interactions on web pages
	3. Design and imlpement UI components for web applications

Future improvements: Create a path that remains (a line) even when the marker moves along the map in order to map the bus route more easily in addition to the stops.
